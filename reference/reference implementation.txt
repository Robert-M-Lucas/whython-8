 - Have refs as special cases for types with same underlying type - how
 - Cast from **type to *type follows ref
 - Cast from *type to type copies
 - Impls accept *self
 - Impl non-static functions only accessible through *type
 - *type.attrib accessed through fixed offset from r9 i.e. mov r9, qword [rbp - *type addr]; mov rax, qword [r9 + x]

Implementing special case:
 - Have first part of names (and types) store indirection amount
